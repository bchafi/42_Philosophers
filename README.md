## 🧠 **What You’re Building**

You are simulating philosophers sitting at a table:
- They alternate between **thinking**, **eating**, and **sleeping**.
- Each philosopher must **pick up two forks** (mutexes) to eat.
- The challenge is to make sure:
  - They don’t **die** from not eating in time.
  - There are **no deadlocks**.
  - The simulation runs **safely with threads**.

---
## ✅ **Step-by-Step Plan**
---

### 🟦 STEP 1: Parsing the Input
You already did this. ✅  
Example:  
```bash
   ./philo 5 800 200 200 7
```
Means:
   - 5 philosophers
   - 800 ms to die
   - 200 ms to eat
   - 200 ms to sleep
   - each philosopher eats 7 times (optional)
---

# 🟦 STEP 2: Create Your Structs
## Create `t_philo` and `t_data` structs:
```c
+-------------------------------+
|            t_data             |  (shared by all philosophers)
|-------------------------------|
| num_philos                    |
| time_to_die                   |
| time_to_eat                   |
| time_to_sleep                 |
| meals_required                |
| start_time                    |
| someone_died                  |---------------------+
| pthread_mutex_t *forks        |---+                 |
| pthread_mutex_t print_lock    |   |                 |
| pthread_mutex_t death_lock    |   |                 |
| t_philo *philos               |---|-----------------+
+-------------------------------+   |
                                    |
                                    v
        +---------------------------------------------------------+
        |     Array of Forks: pthread_mutex_t forks[num_philos]   |
        +---------------------------------------------------------+
         |             |             |                 |
         v             v             v                 v
   [fork0(mutex)] [fork1(mutex)] ...             [forkN-1(mutex)]
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Array of Philosophers: t_philo philos[num_philos]                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id                  (1 ... num_philos)    +-----------------------+ |
| meals_eaten         (per philosopher)     |  >>> per philosopher  | |
| last_meal           (per philosopher)     +-----------------------+ |
| pthread_t thread    (per philosopher)                               |
| pthread_mutex_t meal_lock                                           |
| pthread_mutex_t *left_fork  --> forks[(i+1)%num_philos]             |
| pthread_mutex_t *right_fork --> forks[i]                            |
| t_data *data        (pointer back to shared struct)                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🟦 STEP 3: Initialize Data and Mutexes

## INIT DATA OF THE PROGRAM
   >> init data shared with all philos:
   ```c
      data->meals_required = -1;
      data->num_philos = ft_atoi(args[0]);
      data->time_to_die = ft_atoi(args[1]);
      data->time_to_eat = ft_atoi(args[2]);
      data->time_to_sleep = ft_atoi(args[3]);
      if (args[4])
         data->meals_required = ft_atoi(args[4]);
      pthread_mutex_init(&data->print_lock, NULL);
      /* 
         * Output from threads can overlap if multiple philosophers print at once. 
         * A global print mutex (print_lock) is used so that only one philosopher prints
            a message at a time, making the output readable and synchronized.
      */
      pthread_mutex_init(&data->death_lock, NULL);
      /* 
         * A global death_lock mutex is used to protect access to the shared someone_died flag.
         * This ensures that when one thread checks or sets the simulation's death status, no other
            thread can change it at the same time, preventing inconsistent states.
      */
      data->start_time = get_time_in_ms();
      data->someone_died = 0;
      return data;
   ```
## Allocate `t_philo` array for all philosophers.
   >> Philosophers:
      >> Their IDs
      >> Their forks (left & right)
      >> Their shared data pointer
   ```c
      int i = 0;
      d_dataP->philos = malloc(sizeof(t_philo) * d_dataP->num_philos);
      while (i < d_dataP->num_philos)
      {
         d_dataP->philos[i].id = i + 1;
         d_dataP->philos[i].right_fork = &d_dataP->forks[i];
         d_dataP->philos[i].left_fork = &d_dataP->forks[(i + 1) % d_dataP->num_philos];
         d_dataP->philos[i].meals_eaten = 0;
         d_dataP->philos[i].last_meal = 0;
         d_dataP->philos[i].data = d_dataP;
         pthread_mutex_init(&d_dataP->philos[i].meal_lock, NULL);
         /* 
            * Each philosopher has a meal_lock mutex to protect their own last_meal timestamp.
            * This is important so that the monitor thread and the philosopher thread don’t read/write
               last_meal at the same time, avoiding data races.
         */
         i++;
      }
   ```
## Allocate `pthread_mutex_t` array for forks.
- Mutexes (mutual exclusion objects) are used in your Dining Philosophers project to prevent race conditions 
   and ensure thread safety when multiple threads (philosophers) access shared resources.
   > Forks
      - Each fork is a mutex.
      - Philosophers must lock (pick up) both their left and right fork mutexes before eating, ensuring that two 
        philosophers can’t use the same fork at the same time.
   ```c
      d_dataP->forks = malloc(sizeof(pthread_mutex_t) * d_dataP->num_philos);
      if (!d_dataP->forks)
         return ;
      i = 0;
      while (i < d_dataP->num_philos)
         pthread_mutex_init(&d_dataP->forks[i++], NULL);
   ```
```c
   pthread_mutex_t my_mutex;             // Declare a mutex
   pthread_mutex_init(&my_mutex, NULL); // Initialize the mutex
   pthread_mutex_lock(&my_mutex);      // Lock it (wait if already locked)
   pthread_mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);   // Unlock it
   pthread_mutex_destroy(&my_mutex); // Free resources
```
## **Summary Table**
```c
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |         Mutex        |                    Purpose                          |
   |----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
   | `forks[i]`           | Protects each fork (only one philosopher at a time) |
   | `print_lock`         | Ensures only one thread prints at a time            |
   | `death_lock`         | Safely updates/checks `someone_died` flag           |
   | `meal_lock` (per philo) | Safely updates/checks `last_meal` per philosopher|
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
## Time Start FOR every philos:
   ```c
      d_dataP->start_time = get_time_in_ms();
      i = -1;
      while (++i < d_dataP->num_philos)
         d_dataP->philos[i].last_meal = d_dataP->start_time;
   ```

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## WHEN I RUN A PROGRAM OR EXECUTABLE FILE:
```C
   Start: ./philo
      v
   [Main Thread]  --> runs main()
      +---> Calls pthread_create (for each philosopher and monitor).
      +---> Becomes responsible for joining threads and cleanup.
```
# 🟦 STEP 4: Creating Threads (in depth)
1. Thread vs. Process
> Process:
   - Has its own memory space.
   - Has at least one thread (main thread).
   - Resource intensive to create/switch.
> Thread:
   - Shares memory and resources with other threads in the same process.
   - Light-weight and less resource-intensive.
   - Faster context switching.

## 🎯 Threads:
   - A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a proccess.
   - while the procces is run andepantly with its own memory space.
   - A thread is a lightweight process. It is a sequence of instructions that can run independently within a program.
   - All threads within a process share the same memory space (global variables, heap, etc.), but each has its own stack (local variables).

   >> You want each philosopher to run in parallel, doing their own thing (take forks, thinking, eating, sleeping).
   - To do this, you’ll use pthread_create() to launch a thread per philosopher.
   - Threads are used to perform multiple tasks concurrently within the same program.
## Threads in C (POSIX/pthreads)   ** This code will compile and run on any POSIX-compliant system that supports pthreads. **
   >> In C Programming and Threads:
   - When we say POSIX threads (or pthreads), we refer to the standardized API for creating and managing threads in C/C++ on UNIX-like systems (Linux, macOS, BSD, etc). This API is defined by the POSIX standard.
   - Key points:
      + The header <pthread.h> is part of the POSIX standard.
      + Functions like pthread_create, pthread_join, pthread_mutex_lock, etc., are all POSIX-compliant thread (pthreads) functions.
      + POSIX threads allow you to write multi-threaded code that works across different UNIX-like operating systems.
   \\ When you see "POSIX" in C programming, it means your code is using a portable, standard interface—especially important for threads (concurrency), file operations, and other system-level features. \\
   >> The standard way to use threads in C on Unix-like systems is with the POSIX Threads (pthreads) library 
   >> You must #include <pthread.h> to use pthreads.
  > Key Functions:
   - pthread_create: Create a new thread.
   - pthread_join: Wait for a thread to finish.
   - pthread_exit: End the calling thread.
   >> pthread_t — the thread identifier
```c
   pthread_t thread;
   /*
      > pthread_create will set the value of the pthread_t object for you.
      > The value assigned by pthreads is used internally to track the thread. Its initial value doesn’t matter.
   */
   int pthread_create (
      pthread_t *thread,                  // pointer to thread identifier
      const pthread_attr_t *attr,       // thread attributes (usually NULL)
      void *(*start_routine)(void *), // function the thread will run
      void *arg)                     // argument to the function  

   // Example:
   void *philo_routine(void *arg) {
      // Philosopher's actions here...
      return NULL;}
   pthread_t thread;
   int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *rotine, void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);
   // 🧱 thread: variable to hold the thread
   // 🧱 start_routine: function that the thread will run
   // 🧱 arg: pointer to a struct containing data for that thread
   Main thread
      |
      +-- creates philosopher threads (one per philosopher)
         |
         +-- each thread runs: think -> take forks -> eat -> put down forks -> sleep -> repeat.
      |
      +-- main waits (joins) for all philosopher threads to finis.
```
## How Many Threads in a Process?
   - Main thread: Every C program starts with one thread (the main thread).
   66

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🟦 STEP 5: Write the Philosopher Routine

Each philosopher thread runs this function:

```c
void *philo_routine(void *arg) {
    t_philo *philo = (t_philo *)arg;

    while (!philo->data->someone_died) {
        // Think
        // Pick up forks (mutex lock)
        // Eat
        // Put down forks (mutex unlock)
        // Sleep
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

---

### 🟦 STEP 6: Eating and Forks

Use `pthread_mutex_lock()` to pick up forks.

```c
pthread_mutex_lock(philo->left_fork);
pthread_mutex_lock(philo->right_fork);

// Eat
philo->last_meal = current_time();
philo->meals_eaten++;

pthread_mutex_unlock(philo->right_fork);
pthread_mutex_unlock(philo->left_fork);
```

Also use `usleep(time_to_eat * 1000);` to simulate eating.

---

### 🟦 STEP 7: Add Death Monitor Thread

This thread checks if any philosopher hasn’t eaten in time.

```c
while (1) {
    for (int i = 0; i < data->num_philos; i++) {
        if (current_time() - philo[i].last_meal > data->time_to_die)
        {
            pthread_mutex_lock(&data->print_lock);
            printf("%ld %d died\n", current_time() - data->start_time, philo[i].id);
            data->someone_died = 1;
            return;
        }
    }
    usleep(1000);
}
```

---

### 🟦 STEP 8: Join Threads & Clean Up

After starting threads, use `pthread_join()` to wait for them:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < data->num_philos; i++) {
    pthread_join(philo[i].thread, NULL);
}
```

Then destroy all mutexes.

---
# 🚀 You're Done!

-----

At this point:
- All philosophers are threads.
- Forks are protected with mutexes.
- A monitor detects death.
- Simulation ends cleanly.
